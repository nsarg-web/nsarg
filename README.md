This is the new website for the Northampton Scout ARG built in HTML5 and CSS with Bootstrap
Hi,

This project is a small piece of me learning about CSS HTML5 Bootstrap and all other great things

The Scout Radio group very first presence on the web was produced using Microsoft Frontpage and it stayed that way for more than ten years.
Then in 2016, 2017 I started to re-write the project simply using html and try to introduce CSS.

Now here we are in 2021 and I had another thoought lets try a CMS approach Wordpress, Joomla, this meant that any body without coding skill would be able to help. but learning Wordpress, Joomla was just to difficult So I returned to the way it started and I also found Visual Studio Code and Git.

So here I sit in July 2021 with a free template full of css that I am trying to workout and migrate out simple site over to

The existing site www.nsarg.co.uk and the new dev environment both running on Windows server 2016 IIS

If you are a radio Amateur and involved with Scouts in the UK then please drop us a line and say hi.
If you have a html, js, css skill and you would like to help me learn again drop us a line.
Thanks for taking the time to check us out

Best Wishes
