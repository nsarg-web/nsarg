                                JOTA/JOTI was a little different in 2020 due to Covid restrictions but we still ran a virtual Radio Scouting event over the weekend linking up with other Scouts around the world, either via amateur radio, Zoom or Skype. We are hopeful however that for
                                JOTA/JOTI 2021 we will be running a ‘face-to-face’ Radio station at the Overstone campsite when Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers can again get involved in the exciting world of Radio Scouting linking up with the worldwide
                                family of Scouts around the world. More details to come nearer the event.

                            <h2>Marconi Explorer Scout Unit</h2>
                            <p id="green">The Marconi Explorer Scout Unit was founded on 19th October 2002 during Northampton Scout Amateur Radio Group's 21st birthday celebrations. The first Explorer Scouts were invested early in 2003. The Unit specialises in Radio Scouting
                                and associated technology based activities. It is partnered to the Northampton Scout Amateur Radio Group and meets with NSARG on the 3rd Saturday of each month. Membership of the Marconi Unit is made up of Explorer Scouts who
                                have joined for a variety of reasons. Some have joined the Unit after leaving their Scout Troop to specialise in Radio Scouting activities. Others members have joined as direct entrants at 14 and have not previously been involved
                                in Scouting . Some members have since joined local Explorer Scouts Units or Young Leader Units and two are now warranted leaders. This flexible approach to Explorer Scouting offers an ideal way of "Growing the Movement" and
                                helps retain members when otherwise they would have been lost.

                                    Jamboree on the Air is the highlight of the Radio Scouting calendar, when Scouts have the opportunity to share experiences and exchange ideas with some of the 1.5 million young people taking part. This is truly the biggest Scout Jamboree in the world!
                                    The Northampton Scout Amateur Radio Group has taken part in JOTA every year since 1981. We are hoping that by October 2021 the Covid restrictions will have lifted and that the event can once again be run from the Overstone
                                    Scout Activity Centre. </p>
